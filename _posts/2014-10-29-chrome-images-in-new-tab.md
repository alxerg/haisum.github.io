title: Beautiful Satellie pictures as backgrounds in new tabs of Google Chrome
---

A good friend recommended me [Earth View From Google Maps](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ma/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh/related) chrome extension. It's so good I had to let the world know. It shows me a new satellite image of real world places each time I open a new tab. You should try it out.

Here are some images it showed me:

###Herefordshire United Kindom
